                It is with a strong commitment to the quest for excellence in the field of technical education, that Government Polytechnic, 
                Ahmednagar was established in 1990 and is making rapid progress in enhancing its potential and changing its outlook towards providing 
                better environment required to impart the best all round quality technical education laced with morality.
                We believe that the true potentials of students cannot be realized through academics alone. The students need to be 
                provided with opportunities for exploring and enhancing their talents in extra-curricular activities as well.
                Accordingly, our academic programs are backed up with appropriate co-curricular and extra-curricular inputs 
                promoting culture, sports, self-governance and values; all of which help the students towards becoming complete 
                human beings. We strive to instil a sense of pride and loyalty in our students. We make every effort to equip
                our students professionally and personally, intellectually and emotionally.
